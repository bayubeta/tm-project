Numerical representation of texts as vectors is necessary for text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis. This project compares the performance of different classifiers on IMDB review dataset based on four text vectorization methods: bag-of-words, bag-of-words with tf-idf weights, average of word vectors, and DistilBERT. The results showed that tf-idf vectorizer paired with logistic regression or linear support vector classifier has the best result with 88% accuracy on the test data.
